# AI-Engineer

## 📘 About  
**AI-Engineer** is a learning-by-doing repository created to chronicle my journey into AI engineering. I’ll be exploring key concepts, tools, frameworks, and workflows used in real-world AI system development — with the goal of graduating from theory to production-capable models and pipelines.

The core aims are:  
- Understand how to design, train, deploy and monitor AI models end-to-end.  
- Get hands-on with frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, etc.  
- Learn best practices: data engineering, model evaluation, interpretability, scalability, deployment, MLOps.  
- Build a portfolio of mini-projects and experiments that demonstrate this learning journey.

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
You’ll want:  
- Python 3.8+  
- A virtual environment tool (venv / conda)  
- Common ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)  
- Deep-learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch)  
- (Optional but recommended) Access to GPU or cloud compute for larger experiments  

### Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/LeonMotaung/AI-Engineer.git  
   cd AI-Engineer
